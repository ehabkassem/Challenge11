With Google Colab, a forecasting model has been created to investigate the popularity
of the stock price and traffic on Mercado Libre's website.
Screenshots have been added that speak to some of the answeres in the model. 
In addition, there are two copies of the python code. 
Once was linked directly from Google Colab. The other is a local copy.
